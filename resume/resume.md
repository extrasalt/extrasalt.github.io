# Talks

### The State of the containers

_Chennai Docker meetup, November 2016_  
The sudden rise of containers has led to a lot of bad practices. The talk explained what containers were, how they work internally, how to best avoid inefficient docker setups and how persistent storage works in stateless services.

### Container Orchestration with Kubernetes and Swarm

_Chennai Docker meetup, March 2017_  
Introduction to orchestration and feature comparison of Swarm, Mesos and Kubernetes. Explained different Kubernetes Objects and demoed load balancing in a Kubernetes service. [Slides](http://slides.com/extrasalt/deck)

### Building a baremetal Go PaaS with Kubernetes

_Chennai Go meetup, March 2017_  
Deploying a fully packaged go binary still involves a lot of boilerplate. Presented an alternative where a simple Kubernetes service can deploy any go binary dropped into it and explained how it can be recreated to fit particular needs.

### Reclaiming your infrastructure with Kubernetes

_Indian Linux User Group Chennai, March 2017_  
There is a sentiment in the free software community that IaaS runs largely against the values of Free Software. A federated solution using Kubernetes brings parts of the infrastructure back in-house, reducing costs, without compromising on scalability.

### Docker internals

_Chennai Docker meetup, June 2017_  
Explored how docker works internally and built a self-isolated go program to demonstrate systemcall interface used to create linux containers.
