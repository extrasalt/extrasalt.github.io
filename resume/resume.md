Projects
=========

Podder
------
[Podder](http://github.com/extrasalt/podder) is a multi-tenant baremetal PaaS that runs on top of Kubernetes. It can deploy any go binary that is dropped into it, as a service if it exposes the HTTP port. Podder is an attempt at being the userspace of a distributed operating system. 

Skedole
-------
[Skedole](http://github.com/extrasalt/skedole) is a node.js app that connects to your Google calendar to help you find available slots to schedule your tasks. UI supports both keyboard and mouse input to assign tasks to slots.  

Distbox
-------
[Distbox](http://github.com/extrasalt/distbox) is a personal file storage service backed by IPFS. It is resilent in a way that as long as you have the keys, you can access your files from any independent distbox provider. 

Circle
------
From "The Life Changing Magic of Tidying up", I learnt how reducing clutter can significantly improve our lives. Since I spend my life on a computer, I wrote an application that can organize my folders based on MIME types, regular expressions or file extensions. [Circle](http://github.com/extrasalt/circle) was one of the finalists for [GopherGala](http://gophergala.com/blog/gopher/gala/2015/01/31/finalists/) 2015. 

Community Activities

Co-Organizer of Chennai Go Community  | Since Jan 2017

Talks
=====

### The State of the containers
_Chennai Docker meetup, November 2016_    
The sudden rise of containers has led to a lot of bad practices. The talk explained what containers were, how they work internally, how to best avoid inefficient docker setups and how persistent storage works in stateless services. 

### Container Orchestration with Kubernetes and Swarm
_Chennai Docker meetup, March 2017_    
Introduction to orchestration and feature comparison of Swarm, Mesos and Kubernetes. Explained different Kubernetes Objects and demoed load balancing in a Kubernetes service. [Slides](http://slides.com/extrasalt/deck) 

### Building a baremetal Go PaaS with Kubernetes
_Chennai Go meetup, March 2017_     
Deploying a fully packaged go binary still involves a lot of boilerplate. Presented an alternative where a simple Kubernetes service can deploy any go binary dropped into it and explained how it can be recreated to fit particular needs. 

### Reclaiming your infrastructure with Kubernetes
_Indian Linux User Group Chennai, March 2017_      
There is a sentiment in the free software community that IaaS runs largely against the values of Free Software. A federated solution using Kubernetes brings parts of the infrastructure back in-house, reducing costs, without compromising on scalability. 

### Docker internals
_Chennai Docker meetup, June 2017_      
Explored how docker works internally and built a self-isolated go program to demonstrate systemcall interface used to create linux containers.
