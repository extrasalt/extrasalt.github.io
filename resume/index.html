<h1>Projects</h1>

<h2>Podder</h2>

<p>Podder is a multi-tenant baremetal PaaS that runs on top of Kubernetes. It can deploy any go binary that is dropped into it, as a service if it exposes the HTTP port. Podder is an attempt at being the userspace of a distributed operating system. </p>

<h2>Skedole</h2>

<p>Skedole is a node.js app that connects to your Google calendar to help you find available slots to schedule your tasks. UI supports both keyboard and mouse input to assign tasks to slots.  </p>

<h2>Circle</h2>

<p>From <em>"The Life Changing Magic of Tidying up"</em>, I learnt how reducing clutter can significantly improve our lives. Since I spend my life on a computer, I wrote an application that can organize my folders based on MIME types, regular expressions or file extensions. Circle was one of the finalists for GopherGala 2015. </p>

<h1>Community Activities</h1>

<p>Organizer of the Chennai Docker community | Since Aug 2016
Co-Organizer of Chennai Go Community  | Since Jan 2016</p>

<h1>Talks</h1>

<h3>The State of the containers</h3>

<p><em>Chennai Docker meetup, November 2016</em> <br />
The sudden rise of containers has led to a lot of bad practices. The talk explained what containers were, how they work internally, how to best avoid inefficient docker setups and how persistent storage works in stateless services. </p>

<h3>Container Orchestration with Kubernetes and Swarm</h3>

<p><em>Chennai Docker meetup, March 2017</em> <br />
Introduction to orchestration and feature comparison of Swarm, Mesos and Kubernetes. Explained different Kubernetes Objects and demoed load balancing in a Kubernetes service. </p>

<h3>Building a baremetal Go PaaS with Kubernetes</h3>

<p><em>Chennai Go meetup, March 2017</em> <br />
Deploying a fully packaged go binary still involves a lot of boilerplate. Presented an alternative where a simple Kubernetes service can deploy any go binary dropped into it and explained how it can be recreated to fit particular needs. </p>
